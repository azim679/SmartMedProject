Question,Answer
What is the resting heart rate of an adult?,A normal adult resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Competent athletes have a lower resting heart rate due to better cardiovascular effectiveness.
How does exercise affect heart rate?,"Exercise raises heart rate temporarily because the body requires more oxygen supply. With regular exercise over a period of time, resting heart rate decreases because the heart becomes more efficient."
What are the typical causes of a rapid heart rate?,"Typical causes are stress, dehydration, caffeine, fever, medications, and underlying heart conditions such as arrhythmia."
What are the risks of having a chronic rapid heart rate?,"A chronically rapid heart rate can strain the heart and predispose it to heart disease, high blood pressure, and stroke."
How can I lower my resting heart rate naturally?,"Exercise regularly, stay hydrated, manage stress, get enough sleep, and avoid stimulants (like caffeine) to lower resting heart rate."
"What is bradycardia, and is it dangerous?",Bradycardia is a slower than normal heart rate (below 60 bpm). It is common in athletes but may be a sign of a heart problem if it is associated with dizziness or fainting.
What is tachycardia and why does it happen?,"Tachycardia is a fast heart rate (more than 100 bpm). Stress, fever, dehydration, or conditions such as atrial fibrillation may be the reasons for tachycardia."
Will dehydration lead to a rise in the heart rate?,"Yes, because dehydration lowers the blood volume and raises the heart pressure in the heart and increases the rate."
How do I check my heart rate at home?,You can check your heart rate by placing two fingers on your wrist or neck and counting beats for 60 seconds.
Do medications affect the heart rate?,"Yes, medicines like beta-blockers slow heart rate, but stimulants speed it up."

What should I do if my blood sugar level becomes too low?,"Have something with a fast-acting carbohydrate, such as fruit juice or a glucose tablet."
What is the formula for Body Mass Index?,Your weight divided by metered height times metered height calculates the Body Mass Index. Body Mass Index determines the body fats.

Can walking by oneself lead to weight loss?,Regular walking burns up the calories and improves cardiovascular health.
Why is weight control so important?,"Muscle burns more while at rest than does fat tissue, so the more muscle mass the better for keeping weight under control."
What is the normal pressure of the blood?,Normally the pressure of the blood is 120/80 mmHg.
What are the two readings of the blood pressure?,Pressure while the heart is beating is the higher figure and pressure while the heart is relaxed is the lower figure.
